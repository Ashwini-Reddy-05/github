# github
This is a simple GitHub Profile Finder web application created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The HTML file provides the basic structure with a search box, button, and a section to display user profile details. The CSS file (github.css) is used to design a clean layout and style the input box, button, and profile card. The JavaScript file (github.js) adds functionality by taking the entered username, fetching data from the GitHub API, and displaying the user’s profile information. It also shows an error message if the username is not found. This project demonstrates basic concepts like API usage, DOM manipulation, and event handling in a simple way.
